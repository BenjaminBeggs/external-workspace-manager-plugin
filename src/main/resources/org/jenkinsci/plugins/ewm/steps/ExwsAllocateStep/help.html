        Allocates a disk from the given <i>Disk Pool Ref ID</i>. By default, the disk with the most available space
        is selected. On that disk, it computes the workspace path based on the formula:
        <i>physicalPathOnDisk/$JOB_NAME/$BUILD_NUMBER</i>,
        where <i>physicalPathOnDisk</i> is defined in the Jenkins global config, <i>External Workspace Definitions</i>
        section.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you provide the <i>Upstream</i> parameter, then the <i>Disk Pool Ref ID</i> parameter will be ignored. In
        this case, the step will allocate the same workspace as used by its upstream job. By default, it will select
        the workspace used by the last stable build from the upstream job.
