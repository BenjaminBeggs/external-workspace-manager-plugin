        Optional parameter.
        It indicates the estimated size that the workspace may have.
        It has to be in MB.
        This can influence the Disk allocation strategy used.

        1. Let's suppose that you choose the strategy that selects the disk with the most usable space, and you have
        provided a workspace size estimation of 100 MB.
        The <i>exwsAllocate</i> step will select the disk with the most usable space.
        But, what if that disk has only 80 MB usable space left?
        In this case, the selected disk doesn't have a usable space greater than the estimated workspace size,
        so the disk allocation will fail.
        If the estimated workspace size would not have been provided (or 0), the disk allocation would succeed.

        2. Let's assume that you choose the strategy to select the disk with the highest read speed.
        The estimated workspace size provided is 100 MB.
        You have also defined in the Jenkins global config the read speed (in the Disk Information) for each disk entry.
        Firstly, the strategy will try to find the disk that has the minimum usable space at least equal with the
        estimated workspace size.
        Only then it will try to find another disk that may have a higher speed, but, of course, with the minimum
        usable space required.
        In other words, you may have a disk that has a higher speed than the other one, but if its usable space isn't
        greater than the estimated workspace size, it may not be allocated.
