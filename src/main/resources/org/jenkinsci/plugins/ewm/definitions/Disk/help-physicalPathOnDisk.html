        Used as root path to compute the workspace path on this disk. Optional.
        If provided, it must be a relative path.
    </p>
    <p>
        The workspace path on disk is computed based on the following formula:
        <i>physicalPathOnDisk/$JOB_NAME/$BUILD_NUMBER</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        When the plugin allocates the workspace path to be used within a Node, then the complete workspace path
        has the next pattern, starting with the mounting point from the Jenkins Node to the actual disk:
        <i>/mountPointFromNodeToDisk/physicalPathOnDisk/$JOB_NAME/$BUILD_NUMBER</i>
    </p>
