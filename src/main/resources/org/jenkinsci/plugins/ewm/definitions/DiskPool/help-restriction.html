        Set Disk Pool restriction.
        The <i>exwsAllocate</i> step will fail when allocating the Disk Pool if the restriction doesn't meet the
        requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example you can restrict a Disk Pool to be allocated only if the job was started by a specific user/group.
        Or, you can restrict only if the job name matches a given pattern.
